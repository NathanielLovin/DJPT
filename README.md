This is a small webapp to create Spotify playlists from a GPT-3/4 prompt. It was inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/sjgadler/status/1600948066948771840) from Steve Adler. 

You need to have a Spotify developer API key and an OpenAI API key to run this. Store these how you'd like; I use a .env file and dotenv to load them locally, and the app.yaml file to load them on GCP.

Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions!
